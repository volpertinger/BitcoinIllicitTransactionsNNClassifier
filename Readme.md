# Workflow

## Dataset preprocessing

Preparing raw elliptic dataset for further user in neural network:

Making split into 3 parts (inputs - x and outputs - y):

- Train part, using for NN training
- Test part, using for NN validation during training
- Validation part, for validation after training

Prettify data:

- Delete unnecessary columns
- Delete headers
- Rename classes

Save split data to .csv files

## Dataset Analysing

Analyse dataset internal:

- Plot bars
  - Show plots
  - Save plots
- Print dataset heads

## Model training

- Train model
- Save model

## Analysing train result

- Loading model if we need
- Plot metrics

## Model testing

- Loading model if we need
- Print validation metrics
- Loop with model predictions on validation dataset by indexes from terminal
